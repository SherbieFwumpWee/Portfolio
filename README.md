# About Me
Hi my name is Sherya! I am a recent graduate from Imperial College London in 2025 with a degree in Biological Sciences and Management. During my degree, I got to analyse experimental data using R, Python and Excel, which sparked my interest in data analysis.

Since then, Iâ€™ve strengthened my skills with courses in Python, R, Excel, SQL, and Power BI, and built two projects that apply these tools to real datasets. Iâ€™m now eager to apply what Iâ€™ve learned and am open to opportunities to start my career as a data analyst.
