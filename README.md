## About Me
I am a recent graduate from Imperial College London in 2025 with a degree in Biological Sciences and Management. During my degree, I got to analyse experimental data using Python and Excel, which sparked my interest in data analysis.

Since then, I’ve strengthened my skills with courses in Excel, SQL, and Power BI, and built two projects that apply these tools to real datasets. I’m now eager to apply what I’ve learned and am open to opportunities to start my career as a data analyst.
